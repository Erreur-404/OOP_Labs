# Overview

This repository contains my labs from the Object Oriented Programming course I took at Polytechnique Montr√©al. In these labs, I have applied my C++ object oriented and general knowledge that I gained through the coursework, thus the name of the repo.

These labs were completed in collaboration with [Mo-LK](https://github.com/Mo-LK).
